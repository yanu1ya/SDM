My task was to create doubly linked list with a variety of methods without using built-in libraries

Compilation on Windows:
```shell
>cd ./SDM/lab2/lab2/
>csc Program.cs
>Program.exe
```

Compilation on Linux:
```shell
>cd ./SDM/lab2/lab2/
>mcs Program.cs
>mono Program.exe
```

### UnitTesting
The tests were created using NUnit.Framework c# library
